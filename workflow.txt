Git Workflow Architecture
——————————————————
——————————————————
To implement a Git Workflow Architecture for managing monthly product releases on the 25th of every month, we can use the "Gitflow Workflow" with some customizations. In this workflow, you will have two primary branches: master and develop, along with feature and release branches. Here's a suggested workflow:

* 		Main Branch (master):
    * The main branch represents the production-ready code. All code in this branch is thoroughly tested and ready for deployment.
    * Releases to production happen from this branch.

* 		Develop Branch (develop):
    * The develop branch is used for ongoing development. Features and bug fixes are merged into this branch during the development phase.
    * This branch is considered the "unstable" version for ongoing development.

* 		Feature Branches (feature):
    * For each new feature or enhancement, create a feature branch from develop.
    * Develop the feature in this branch and test it thoroughly.
    * Once the feature is ready, merge it into develop.
    * Feature branches should be named descriptively, such as feature/user-authentication.

* 		Release Branches (release):
    * A new release branch is created from develop on the 1st of every month. We can name these branches based on the release version, such as release/1.0.
    * During the month, bug fixes and final testing are performed in this branch.
    * On the 25th of the month, if the release branch is stable and ready for production, it's merged into main for the release.

* 		Hotfix Branches (hotfix/*):
    * If critical bugs or issues are discovered in the main branch, create a hotfix branch from main.
    * Fix the issue in this branch and test it thoroughly.
    * Once the issue is resolved, merge the hotfix into both main and develop.
