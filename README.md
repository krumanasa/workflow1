## Overview

Welcome to the Monthly Product Release Workflow repository for [Project Name]. This repository outlines the Git Workflow Architecture for managing our product releases, which occur on the 25th of every month. We follow a structured process to ensure the quality and consistency of our releases.

## Git Workflow Architecture

Our Git Workflow Architecture consists of several key branches:

- **Main (`main`)**: Represents the production-ready code and the latest stable release. This branch is updated on the 25th of each month.

- **Develop (`develop`)**: Used for ongoing development. Features and enhancements are developed in feature branches and merged into this branch.

- **Feature Branches (`feature/*`)**: Created for new features or enhancements. Feature branches are merged into the `develop` branch upon completion.

- **Release Branches (`release/*`)**: Created on the 1st of every month for preparing the next release. These branches are merged into both `master` and `develop` when the release is ready.

- **Hotfix Branches (`hotfix/*`)** (if needed): Created to fix critical bugs in the `main` branch. Hotfix branches are merged into both `main` and `develop`.

For more details, please refer to the [workflow.txt](./workflow.txt) file.

## Branches

- [**Main Branch**](./main.txt): Production-ready code for the latest release.
- [**Develop Branch**](./develop.txt): Ongoing development branch.
- [**Feature/user-authentication Branch**](./feature.txt): Feature branch for user authentication.
- [**Release Branch**](./release.txt): Release branch for version 1.0.
- [**Hotfix Branch**](./hotfix.txt) (if needed): Hotfix branch for critical bug fixes.

## Pseudo-Code Files

Each branch contains a corresponding pseudo-code file that outlines the purpose and workflow for that branch. You can review these files to understand our Git Workflow Architecture.

## Getting Started
